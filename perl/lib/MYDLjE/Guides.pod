=head1 MYDLjE Guides

Here is the place to start, no matter if you are a developer, designer, administrator
 or editor.

=head1 ADMINISTRATORS

The L<MYDLjE::Guides::Admins> guide is for those who build and manage one 
or several sites based on MYDLjE.
It is expected that you have general knowledge on how the I<World Wide Web> works and are familiar with notions like Apache, HTTP, FTP, XML, XHTML. Some knowledge of Perl and JavaScript is useful but not mandatory.

Thanks for using MYDLjE!

=head1 DEVELOPERS

The L<MYDLjE::Guides::Devs> guide is for those who want to build their own
applications on top of MYDLjE and contribute to the project by 
implementing features and fixing bugs. Please read it before you contribute.

Thanks for joining!

=head1 DESIGNERS

The L<MYDLjE::Guides::Design> guide is intended for XHTML/CSS savvy people who want to use
the bundled Elastic CSS framework and jQuery UI(L<http://jqueryui.com/>).
Well, for now it is enough to look at the templates files and read the docs on 
L<http://elasticss.com/documentation/>. There are also very good screencasts.




=head1 EDITORS

Editors are those who just write and publish content on the web. In MYDLjE we do not have 
a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get ) editor interface. This is in purpose.
These tools rarely do things right and often hinder full control on the content.
Instead we leave the content to the editor (human). We just help by adding some buttons for
 quick formatting  and snippets generation on top of textareas. This is made using the L<MarkItUp|http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/home/> editor.
