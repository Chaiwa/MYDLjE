=head1 MYDLjE - Web-presence rethought

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE: Everything below is just a TODO-list for now.>

MYDLjE is a collection of Perl, JavaScript, CSS and HTML5 code libraries to 
form a General Purpose Platform for building Web-Applications.

We count on several "State Of the Art" open source software projects to 
make a powerful platform.

The framework name is an acronym. It stands for:
B<Mojolicious, YAML, DBI*, Locale::Maketext, jQuery, Elastic CSS> which are
the main building blocks. B<Template::Alloy> is yet another solid rock on 
which we stand.

=head1 APPLICATIONS

MYDLjE comes with two bundled web applications around and on top of which 
you can build even more powerful domain specific applications. 
The applications are intended to be usable for the average 
computer-literate user.

=head2 CONTROL PANEL (cpanel)

This application is for managing your platform. You access and manage 
your users, customers, site, pages, content, applications etc. from here. 
Only trusted people should be allowed to use it.

=head2 SITE (site)

This is your front-end application intended for the public. Build a site 
or a custom application to be used by your customers. Build whatever you 
want on top of and around it.
