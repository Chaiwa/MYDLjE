=head1 MYDLjE - Web-presence rethought

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE: Everything below is just a TODO-list for now.>

MYDLjE is a lightweight Web-Applications and Content Management Framework.
It is a collection of Perl, JavaScript, CSS and HTML5 code libraries to form a General Purpose Platform for building Web-Applications.
We count on several "State Of the Art" open-source software projects to make a powerful platform for building business online.

The framework name is an acronym. It stands for: B<Mojolicious, YAML, DBI*, Locale::Maketext, jQuery, Elastic CSS> which are the main building blocks. B<Template::Alloy> is chosen as view system. B<SILK & FLAG ICONS> are used too.

=head1 APPLICATIONS

MYDLjE comes with three bundled web applications around and on top of which you can build even more powerful domain specific applications. 
The applications are intended to be easy to use (intuitive) for the average computer-literate user.

=head2 CONTROL PANEL (cpanel)

This application is for managing your platform. You access and manage your users, customers, site, pages, content, applications etc.  
Only trusted people (back-end users) should be allowed to use it.

=head2 MYDLjE (mydlje)

This is a bare-bones application. It it is used as the base for the other two.

=head2 SITE (site)

This is your front-end application intended for the public. Build a site or a custom application to be used by your customers. 
Build whatever you want on top of and around it.
