=head1 MYDLjE - Web-presence rethought

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE: Almost everything below is just a TODO-list for now.>

MYDLjE is a lightweight Web-Applications and Content Management Framework.
It is a collection of Perl, JavaScript, CSS and HTML5 code to make a General Purpose Platform for building Web-Applications.
We build on top of several I<"State Of the Art"> open-source software projects to make a powerful platform for starting your own business online.

The framework name is an acronym. It stands for: B<Mojolicious, YAML, DBI*, Locale::Maketext, jQuery, Elastic CSS> which are the main building blocks. B<Template::Alloy> is chosen as view system. B<SILK & FLAG ICONS> are used too.

=head1 APPLICATIONS

MYDLjE comes with three bundled web applications around and on top of which you can build even more powerful domain specific applications. 
The applications are intended to be easy to use (intuitive) for the average computer-literate user.

=head2 CONTROL PANEL (cpanel)

This application is for managing your online presence. You access and manage your users, customers, site, pages, content, applications etc.  
Only trusted people (back-end users) should be allowed to use it.

=head2 MYDLjE (mydlje)

This is a bare-bones application. It is used as the base for the other two applications and for setting up the system for the first time when you unpack it where it will work.

=head2 SITE (site)

This is your front-end application intended for the public. Build a site or a custom application to be used by your community and/or customers. 
Build whatever you want on top of and around it.



=head1 MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS

=over

=item * Perl 5.8.8 or next;

=item * Apache with mod_cgi (standard) or (better/faster) mod_fcgi/mod_fastcgi;

=item * MySQL >=5.0 server, provided on every shared hosting;

=item * C<DBI>, C<DBD::mysql>, C<Time::Piece> and C<GD> Perl Modules.

=back


Almost all (even the cheapest) hosting providers meet the system requirements. 
To make sure, send the list to your (potential) hosting provider and ask them if they meet the requirements below. The setup screen also checks for the requirements. The system runs under mod_cgi by default, but cen be configured very easily to run under mod_fastcgi (or mod_fcgi) if available. See the .htaccess file in the project root directory.


=head1 INSTALLATION

=item 1 Unpack the bundle in a directory visible by Apache.

=item 2 Use your browser to access B<index.xhtml> - see L</SETUP>.
