Home dirs for users are here.
These files are by default seen trough web.
They are served by the Apache/NGINX server.
Every user when created gets a personal directory - how convenient.
The users belonging to his group can read and may be write into his directory.
This directory ($MOJO_HOME/pub/home) MUST be writable by the "cpanel" and "site" applications.
